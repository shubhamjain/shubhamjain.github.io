  <div class="entry-content"><p>The notion of 10x programmer was first mentioned by John Brooks (of, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law">Brook&rsquo;s law</a> fame) in his essay <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">No Silver Bullet</a>, according to which, &lsquo;there is as much as a tenfold difference between an ordinary designer (programmer) and a great one&rsquo;. The idea has been widely debated, sometimes refuted and many times defended which is unsurprising for it is impossible to accurately measure a programmer&rsquo;s productivity.</p>

<p>Sadly, the idea of 10x coder is usually visualized as a screen glued junkie, moving fingers over keyboard without a break. While the picture may be popular for sci-fi films, it is hardly close to reality.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If there was an award for the most hated language, the unanimous winner would be PHP. Lots of write-ups criticize it for its nonsensical function naming conventions, inconsistent parameters, sheer absence of what we call, &ldquo;a well thought design&rdquo;. However, people on the other side, suggest that writing good code is upto the programmer showcasing &ldquo;Zend Framework&rdquo;, they assert, PHP is a very reasonable language to write clean code. They say its easy to ignore the inconsistencies with a good editor or IDE and adopting good practices. True they are, I believed, until, I encountered something which is completely inexcusable, an ugly case of type juggling.</p>

<h2>Type Juggling</h2>

<p>Type Juggling (or, automatic type casting) is a PHP mechanism which transforms one type to another depending upon the context. As <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php">the manual</a> explains, if you add a string to a number, the string will be type casted to a number and not the other way round which results in something like this.</p>

<p><code>20 + "10Hello World" = 30</code></p>

<p>Although, I can guess this behavior was added, because string concatenation was already being done with (dot) operator but an ill conceived functionality, as such, can serve a major blow to programmers in trying to figure out why something doesn&rsquo;t work. Take an example of <code>in_array</code> and type juggling. Suppose, you are checking presence of a string in mixed array. To your surprise, you would find that the following spills out true, because when comparing &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; with 0, the former is casted to integer zero.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Type Juggling and in_array </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;was&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;invented&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;in&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;india&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">var_dump</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nb">in_array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$arr</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Although, yes, PHP allows you to do the strict checking, if you invoke the third parameter of <code>in_array</code> but point remains: why should this happen when it is not supposed to?</p>

<p>Let me tell you an incident, how this behavior hit me badly.</p>

<h2>bindParam() and Type Juggling</h2>

<p>Suppose, you have a big MySQL prepared query for a &ldquo;school&rdquo; table which also stores 10th grade scores in column, &ldquo;10th_grade&rdquo;. So the query goes like this,</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Type Juggling and bind_param() </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$sql</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$pdo</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">prepare</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;INSERT INTO school_scores(......10th_grade.....) VALUES(....&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="nx">th_grade</span><span class="s2">&quot;....);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="si">$sql-&gt;bindParam</span><span class="s2">(&quot;</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="nx">th_grade</span><span class="s2">&quot;, isset(</span><span class="si">$data[&quot;10th_grade&quot;]</span><span class="s2">) ? </span><span class="si">$data[&quot;10th_grade&quot;]</span><span class="s2"> : NULL);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="si">$sql-&gt;execute</span><span class="s2">();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Looks fine? but you get an error: &ldquo;number of bound variables does not match number of tokens&rdquo;. You recheck everything, the parameter count on both sides are correct, data is correct but still it is the same. So where is the culprit?</p>

<p>The culprit here is PHP which juggles the type of &ldquo;10th_grade&rdquo; to 10 and inserts the assigns value to parameter #10, as bindParam&rsquo;s first parameter accepts two types of arguments. Finding the flaw here was quite hard because a) you don&rsquo;t know what you are looking for b) PDO <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.debugdumpparams.php">debugDumpParams</a> doesn&rsquo;t even print what values were passed making debugging almost impossible.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Although, it can still be said, how such things might still be avoided if you know them but what can&rsquo;t be answered is &ndash; why? Why should one not avoid PHP choose other superior languages over it. The argument of being easy to use and deploy remained true when other stacks lacked simplicity and ease but not today, when web offers far more choices of frameworks and tools. I won&rsquo;t say I would completely refrain from using PHP but I would definitely avoid it in fear of encountering another of its nastiness.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Terminals are an essential place frequented by developers in their daily use. In contrast to GUIs, command line gives you more folds of power and transparency when you dealing with a complicated tool like git, or when you need to pull off some networking stats using <code>netstat</code>. In this blog post, I&rsquo;ll explain why tmux is a great productivity enhancer when working with command line.</p>

<h2>What is tmux?</h2>

<p><strong>tmux</strong> or terminal multiplexer is a simpler version of GNU screen, both of which are tools to split, combine and create terminal windows. Yes, that is indeed similar to what <strong>terminator</strong> does but guess what, you can&rsquo;t run terminator on SSH, can you? but that is not the selling point here. tmux is command line based tool which is very easy to use and in fact for any beginner, a <a href="http://danielmiessler.com/study/tmux/">little primer</a> should be enough to start using it to its full extent.</p>

<h2>Why should one use tmux?</h2>

<p>I use tmux even when I am working locally. In comparison to terminator, tmux offers a significant advantage by freeing your hands from needing to get to the mouse. When working over command line, anything other than keyboard is an interruption and costs in your work flow. Just like tabbed browsing, multiples panes and windows allow you to do many things at once and with tmux you are encouraged to exploit them more effectively. Other significant features include :</p>

<ul>
<li>You can use it over SSH.</li>
<li>You can share a session on SSH with use of sockets.</li>
<li>You can de-attach and run multiple sessions.</li>
<li>Using tmux-sessions you can dump and restore sessions after boot.</li>
</ul>


<p>In a better combination of both tabbed terminals and tmux, one can use separate tabs for both local and remote machines and tmux can be used inside each tab, helping to avoid confusion between the two.</p>

<h2>A typical use-case scenario</h2>

<p>A typical usefulness of tmux can be illustrated when you are debugging and internal server error over SSH. My normal mode of operation in such cases was to keep switching directories using <code>cd -</code> alternating between adjusting configurations and viewing error logs. Using tmux this process was a lot simpler since all you needed was to switch tabs. Even better, you could use <code>watch</code> command in a separate pan to constantly output the <code>tail error_log</code> to console, thus, saving your time and watching constantly switching directories.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately, on independence day we needed to introduce a small logo change on our website to acknowledge it. The change wasn&rsquo;t meant to last for more than a few days and hence, the problem of introducing a temporary change which shouldn&rsquo;t be a part of the history arose. Out of ignorance, we went through the path of making a commit and later reverting it with <code>git-revert</code>. Recently I found about excellent patching system of git which makes an impressive solution for the problem.</p>

<h2>Patching </h2>

<p>Patching used in git isn&rsquo;t unique. It derives itself from an old <code>patch</code> program written by Larry Wall in 1985. <code>patch</code> program is pretty simple. It takes a diff file as its input and applies those changes to corresponding files. Because of this simplicity, it makes patch files very easy to send. Perhaps, before the advent of github, they were the old man&rsquo;s pull request. Another great thing about patches is that they can painlessly be reversed.</p>

<p>Git&rsquo;s <code>format-patch</code> is an extension of <code>patch</code> and offers two advantages over it. First, it generates an email formatted patch file which is much easier to be sent via <code>mailutils</code>. Secondly, it supports binary diffs which means if you have a binary file which was created in the patch, git&rsquo;s patch file will have record of it and it will be created when patch is applied. The best thing about git&rsquo;s patching system is that it can be applied even if the folder is not a git repository, making it suitable for use over production servers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are lots of things to get excited about HTML5 and the one which caught my curiosity was HTML5 Audio / Video API. I was overwhelmed with ideas of practical applications like face detect login or inline dictation but I chose to start with something small &ndash; a whistle detector. Although, not wholly accurate it works quite well with very a good accuracy. I used M. Nilsson&rsquo;s research paper, &ldquo;<a href="http://medieteknik.bth.se/fou/forskinfo.nsf/all/67a079f0676c546fc12574a4002d6d38/$file/nilsson-whistle.pdf">Human Whistle Detection and Frequency Estimation</a>&rdquo; to implement this. It took me a while to get understand exactly what the paper narrates with its mathematical notations but luckily my wandered at the right place to get the right idea.</p>

<p>For the first part, I would try to explain <a href="http://btu.se/fou/forskinfo.nsf/17e96a0dab8ab6a1c1257457004d59ab/2660bccb72bce3ccc125714d004828c1/$file/successive%20mean...pdf">Successive Mean Quantization Transform (SMQT)</a> which prepares the audio data for further processing.</p>

<h2>Successive Mean Quantization Transform</h2>

<p>Transformation in mathematics is an operation to map one set to another set. SMQT is a similar method to do the same to remove bias or gain resulting from disparity between various kinds of sensors (microphones) and other factors. In SMQT, we recursively take mean of data set and split it into two halves and do the same on each half. Data values above the mean are assigned, &ldquo;1&rdquo; and below are assigned &ldquo;0&rdquo;. The recursion is carried out to a pre-defined depth, at the end of which we have a binary tree with 1s and 0s. Sounds confusing? Lets take and example of set:</p>

<p><code>X = [89, 78, 63, 202, 90, 45, 112, 79, 95, 87, 90, 78, 54, 34, 66, 32]</code>.</p>

<p><code>Mean(X) = 80.875</code></p>

<p>The values above mean are assigned &ldquo;1&rdquo; while below are assigned &ldquo;0&rdquo;. So it becomes &ndash; <code>[1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0]</code>. Let this procedure be called as <code>U(X)</code>. Data values corresponding to &ldquo;0&rdquo; propagate left of the binary tree while &ldquo;1&rdquo; propagate right. So we have a tree which looks like,</p>

<p><img src="/images/whistle/tree.jpg"></p>

<p>Continue this process recursively till you reach a depth of L. ( <strong>Note</strong>: L = 8 in our application. )</p>

<p>After this, you weight each level by multiplying the bits by 2<sup>cur_level &ndash; 1</sup> and add it up to the top of tree. So, if you have a tree which looks like,</p>

<p><img src="/images/whistle/tree2.jpg"></p>

<p>Multiply D, E, F, G by 2<sup>2</sup> which gives <code>[4 0 4 0]</code>, <code>[0 0 4 0]</code>, <code>[0 0 4 4]</code>, <code>[4 0 0 0]</code> and so on. Lets call this procedure of weighing individual arrays as <code>W(X)</code>. After we are done weighing, we add to the node its subtrees. For eg, <code>B = W(B) + (W(D) . W(E))</code>. So we have now have audio data that is bias and gain free. (<a href="https://gist.github.com/shubhamjain/88f14b328e7b145c79e5#file-smqt-js">Gist</a>).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So you think desktop apps will die a slow death? The sentiment of demise of desktop apps has been professed by many people, <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/all-programming-is-web-programming">Jeff Atwood</a>, <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/09/05/desktop-aps-versus-web-apps/">Patrick McKenzie</a> to name a few. With colossal jump in our web technologies, both performance and capability wise, something that couldn&rsquo;t have been possible few years back, the idea is getting even more traction. When you see demos like <a href="http://media.tojicode.com/q3bsp/">this</a>, you are tempted to think if web browsers would be able to address the performance issue, what would withhold for web to be used for everything from games to essential business software?</p>

<p>So why do I think desktop apps still make sense?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Passiveness of income</strong>: While it may be true, web apps fare great when it comes to potential revenue, cross-platform comparability, and reach, it is indispensable to avoid working actively on it. Have you ever heard of someone who was pulling off revenue his age old SaSS app without putting in any work? On the other side, I still get sales from one of my stupid script that I made a long time ago and never even marketed. May be a generalized scenario; it might be possible someone earns a passive income from his web app without adding anything but it is hard to think that the developer can avoid tasks like marketing, server monitoring, dealing with quirky consumer issues, or scaling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Less overhead in selling</strong>: Selling a web app means, integrating it with an API to accept payments, offer a X days trial, send emails reminding trial period is ending and charge card on recurring basis. By any chance, if you happened to use paypal and their API be prepared to pull your hair off in doing this. In contrast, selling desktop apps is much easier with many services available for selling downloads &ndash; gumroad, softpedia, CNET.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lesser obligations to deal with issues</strong>: With a web app, you are expected immediately to address any issue that pops up and with many peculiarities of CSS and HTML, it is reasonable to expect that in &ldquo;some browser&rdquo; on &ldquo;some device&rdquo;, the text is overflowing outside the container. If you are dealing with a desktop app, you have plenty of time till the next release is due (except for security issues, of course).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So it boils down to how desktop apps are about writing code and shipping where as web apps require you to be there always. Although, you probably won&rsquo;t lose customer over some little CSS issue but the way your mind works, you won&rsquo;t be able to stop yourself from addressing it immediately and that is where desktop apps have an upper hand &ndash; you can prioritize which things to add / fix / remove in the next release. One example of this has been documented by Joel Spolsky.</p>

<blockquote><p>As Excel 5 was nearing completion, I started working on the Excel 6 spec with a colleague, Eric Michelman. We sat down to go through the list of &ldquo;Excel 6&rdquo; features that had been cut from the Excel 5 schedule. We were absolutely shocked to see that the list of cut features was the shoddiest list of features you could imagine. Not one of those features was worth doing. I don&rsquo;t think a single one of them was ever done, even in the next three releases. The process of culling features to fit a schedule was the best thing we could have done.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The de-facto bot prevention technique sprawls everywhere on the web but I am surprised how people overestimate the difficulty of breaking a captcha. Here are some of them which I encountered.</p>

<p><img src="/images/captchas/1.jpg"> <img src="/images/captchas/2.jpg"> <img src="/images/captchas/3.jpg"></p>

<p>It won’t take rocket science to convert them to text. In fact, the only two free tools needed for this purpose are: <a href="http://code.google.com/tesseract-ocr%E2%80%8E">tesseract</a> and <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">Imagemagick</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Convert command </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>convert captcha.jpg -threshold 5% a.jpg
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Adjust the threshold value to get a binary image with no noise.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Tesseract </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>tesseract -l eng a.jpg text
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will create a “text.txt” file with the captcha text in it.</p>

<p>I ran a test on effectiveness of these commands and the success rate was nearly 9 / 10, clearly implying how weak or better say, made-from-scratch captcha implementations are as good as having none at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Note</strong>: I am not an audio expert or even close to one. This post may pose amateur attempts to do something very trivial. Link to the Github repository.</p>

<p>Ever had one of those moments, when you are super excited about accomplishing a challenge, having put something useful on the table, only to realize it is not even close to the greatness you imagined; to be bitter, futile? This weekend I build something to detect earphone button presses and control VLC media player with it but it was not so useful afterall.</p>

<h2>Earphone Presses</h2>

<p><img src="/images/earphone/earphone.jpg" width="128" height="128" title="&#34;Samsung Earphones&#34;" alt="&#34;Samsung Earphones&#34;"></p>

<p>(<a href="http://images.esellerpro.com/2477/I/488/907/lrgscaleEHS60-WHITE-0.jpg">Link to original image</a>)</p>

<p>I own a pair of Samsung earphones, intrigued how the buttons used to switch / pause tracks in smartphones work, I plugged in the pieces in my combo jack, used audacity, pressed a button and the result was:</p>

<p><img src="/images/earphone/wave.png" title="Wave form for button press" alt="Wave form for button press" /></p>

<p>&ldquo;Great! Awesome find!&rdquo; exclaimed my mind. So how can we make this into something useful?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week I went crazy about file formats. I tried to understand specifications of many popular formats like MP3, FLV, PDF. Its amazing to see that no matter how complex these technologies are or the algorithms they use to store media efficiently, at the lower level it is just a clever arrangement of bits that makes sense and with a bit of experimentation and hacking around MP3 format (a Hex Editor is a invaluable tool in this), I was able to read them in PHP without using any extension. The source has been put on <a href="https://github.com/shubhamjain/PHP-ID3">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Binary File Reader</h2>

<p>The native method for reading a binary file  is unpack(). The problem with it was that it can’t handle variable length chunks, and I found it tough to understand the format of packing codes. Unluckily, I realized it quite late (damn!), that I can create the reader more efficiently by using unpack() function. (<a href="https://gist.github.com/shubhamjain/5964350">Gist</a>)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in the days, I used to be the crazy money minded programmer writing kLOCs of crap with no code quality concern, for projects I often found on freelancing sites. Freelancer.com, oDesk and likes which seem to be quite popular among employers looking for cheap third world country coders but honestly, if you think about being a better programmer, never log in to them. Why?</p>
